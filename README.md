# SPARCK
SPatial Augmented Reality Contruction Kit.

Also includes QueScript.

## Installation

There are three flavors of SPARCK:

* The standalone app.
* Running the app inside MaxMSP. You need [Max](https://cycling74.com/downloads/) and the SPARCK package, but there is no need for a Max license.
* The SPARCK package for creating [Max](https://cycling74.com/downloads/) patches based on SPARCK nodes. This allows to use the full power of Max in combination with SPARCK. This requires a [Max license](https://cycling74.com/shop).

### Download

#### Standalone APP

#### Max Package
